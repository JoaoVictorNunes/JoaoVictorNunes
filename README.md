### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist from Brazil. I'm currently doing a Master's Program at Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), with a research line on Data Science. 
I have passed the Data Analyst Associate certification at DataCamp (https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DAA0017055292151), and I'm also studying to get certificate as a Data Scientist.

I have a few cool data analysis projects, which I'd like to show everyone.

## Food Claims Process: https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/6f5d74d3-6ecb-4418-8632-8f77abb547ec
### Background: 
Vivendo is a fast food chain in Brazil with over 200 outlets.
Customers often claim compensation from the company for food poisoning.
The legal team processes these claims. The legal team has offices in four locations.
The legal team wants to improve how long it takes to reply to customers and close claims.
The head of the legal department wants a report on how each location differs in the time it
takes to close claims.
