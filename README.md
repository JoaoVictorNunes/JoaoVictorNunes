### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist from Brazil. I'm currently coursing a Master's Program at Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), with a research line on Data Science. 
I have passed the Data Analyst Associate certification at DataCamp (https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DAA0017055292151), and I'm also studying to get certificate as a Data Scientist.

Below, you can see some of my Data Science and Data Analysis Projects.

## Data Analysis Projects

### Food Claims Process: https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/6f5d74d3-6ecb-4418-8632-8f77abb547ec
> This project aims to analyze Vivendo, fast food chain in Brazil with over 200 outlets. In this food chain, customers often claim compensation from the company for food poisoning. The big question is: is there any relation between the time to close and the location of the claim?

### Carbon Dioxide Emissions by cars
> This project aims to explain the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by several types of cars.

### Is Azul Stocks' value correlated with ^BVSP, tax rate or interest tax? 
> In this project, I analyze if there is any relation with the value of the Azul stocks (AZUL4.SA) and some macroeconomics indicators.
